<h1 align='center'>~ Declaration ~</h1>

We have three different ways to declare variables.

```javascript
var firstName = 'John';
let age = 18;
const passingGrade = 'C';
```

<p>The let keyword is same as var except that it has block scope feature. This is something which will be discussed more in the next lecture 'variable scoping'. The const keyword is same as both the var and let except that it can only be assigned once and cant be reassigned again.</p>

<p>Naming convention for javascript variable declaration are below:</p>

```javascript
// a - z (lower case alphabet)
// A - Z (upper case alphabet)
// _     (underscore)
// $     (dollar sign)
// 0 - 9 (numbers)
```
