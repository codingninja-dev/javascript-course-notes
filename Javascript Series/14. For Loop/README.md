<h1 align='center'>~ For Loop ~</h1>

<p>A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.</p>

```javascript
for(var x = 1 ; x <= 10 ; x++) {
  console.log(x);
}
// it will log out from 1 - 10
```
<p>Each part of the for loop is described below.</p>

<h3>Initial Expression</h3>

```javascript
var x = 1
```
<p>This is a variable use to keep track of your loop progress (keep track how many times the loop has passed).</p>

<h3>Condition Expression </h3>

```javascript
x <= 10
```
<p>This condition is used by the for loop to evaluate whether the loop should continue or end based on the counter variable 'x'.</p>

<h3>Increment Expression</h3>

```javascript
x++
```
<p>This is used to update the counter variable 'x' when ever the loop has completed its pass.</p>
